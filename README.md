# EnergyPlus-VRF-FanCoil-EMS
A random building was chosen from university of Cyprus campus. The building has the ability of monitoring temperatures through sensors. Energy coefficient, estimated temperatures, fault analysis and monitoring temperatures is the result of three simulations of three different models.
